# healio-bellhacks
Healio app that uses a custom data set, prompt engineering, and python backend to create an AI model based on GPT-4 that will diagnose a disease based on symptoms and return drugs needed for that disease and its cost. 
This app was partially built. It was fully built on the backend with some front end and was primarily missing the API to connect the frontend and backend.
